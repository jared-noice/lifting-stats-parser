# lifting-stats-parser
A parser to extract relevant data from my weightlifting notes over time.
This parser reads through the _full_data.txt_ text file and outputs a list of each exercise with each sets and reps for that exercise over time.
This is then easily ported to an Excel spreadsheet for further "progress over time" analysis.
